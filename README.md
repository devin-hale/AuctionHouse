# Plan 5-19-23
v1 will just be a hardcoded shopping portal using primarily HTML and CSS, in order to align with the requirements of The Odin Project Admin Dashboard project.  It will include a basic layout using grid and flexbox, and utilize images and icons from World of Warcraft to make it appear themed around an auction house.  It will include static cards that act as info boxes for each item, including basic stats and a cost in gold.

Eventually I would like to update it to generate these cards automatically by pulling from a WoW item data base.  Maybe even the official WoW API?  It would pull items at random and populate the cards with the info.  Maybe filters on the side for item type, quality, cost, etc.

I would also like to add a fake checkout.

Maybe also a fake login.
